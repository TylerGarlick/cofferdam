# cofferdam

Azure DocumentDB library to ease development with DocumentDB

### Why the name?

I thought the name coffer would be cool for a document datastore. Unfortunately, that was taken.  

> A *coffer* is defined as any of various boxlike enclosures, as a cofferdam.

I like to think of documents inside of containers as something like a coffer, ergo a cofferdam.
